Designed synthetic datasets simulating traffic volume, speed, and congestion using NumPy and Gaussian/Poisson distributions. Developed a sinusoidal-based non-linear model capturing sensitivity to initial conditions and emergent chaotic behavior in traffic systems. Conducted statistical and visual analysis in Python to reveal deterministic yet unpredictable patterns in urban congestion, offering implications for scalable, adaptive city traffic management.
